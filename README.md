### Project **Sound genereator**

**About**

Made a simple script that prints a randomized property from an array. The main point is that you can choose any music album by clicking on the button. Next, you can follow the link to Spotify and listen to it. Also added to the background of the looped video to make it more dynamic. You can follow the link to the GitHub Pages and try it. Enjoy!
